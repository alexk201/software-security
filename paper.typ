  This paper presents a novel approach to cybersecurity defense through the integration of
  access control mechanisms with honeypot technologies. I demonstrate that this unified
  approach significantly enhances malware detection and response capabilities while
  maintaining system performance and usability. My research extends existing security
  frameworks by implementing dynamic policy adjustments based on threat intelligence
  gathered from honeypot interactions. The results show substantial improvements in threat
  detection accuracy and response times compared to traditional segregated security
  approaches.

= Introduction
The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, presenting
organizations with increasingly complex challenges in protecting their digital assets.
According to Verizon's comprehensive Data Breach Investigations Report, organizations
experienced a significant surge in sophisticated attacks in 2023, with particular growth in
advanced persistent threats (APTs) across all sectors [1]. The financial implications of these
attacks have been substantial, with cybersecurity Ventures projecting global damages from
cybercrime to exceed \$10.5 trillion annually by 2025 [2].
Traditional approaches to malware defense have historically treated access control,
intrusion detection, and honeypot systems as distinct entities. This separation has created
potential gaps in security coverage that sophisticated attackers can exploit. Building upon
the foundational work in honeypot-based detection by Kreibich and Crowcroft [3], my
research proposes an integrated approach that combines these critical security components
into a cohesive defense system.

  if n <= 2 { 1 } else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
